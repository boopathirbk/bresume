This repository houses the source code for my personal portfolio website. It serves as a live demonstration of my capabilities in **Frontend Architecture, Accessibility Standards, and Performance Optimization**.

## 🌟 Project Overview

Designed to be lightweight and high-performance, this project eschews heavy frameworks in favor of modern, semantic **Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3**. It achieves a perfect balance between a premium aesthetic ("Vercel-like" design) and strict accessibility compliance.

## 💎 Key Features

### 🎨 Premium Design System
- **Modern Aesthetic**: Deep dark mode with subtle grid backgrounds and glowing accents.
- **Fluid Responsiveness**: A mobile-first architecture that scales seamlessly from phones to 4K displays.
- **Micro-Interactions**: Custom-built animations, including a unique **Spinning Rainbow Border** button.

### ♿ Advanced Accessibility Suite
Built to exceed WCAG 2.1 AA standards, featuring a custom A11y Widget:
- **Granular Control**: Text resizing, grayscale mode, and high-contrast themes.
- **Cognitive Load**: "Readable Font" mode and motion reduction settings.
- **Navigation**: Full keyboard support with visible focus states.

### ⚡ Technical Performance
- **Zero Dependencies**: No framework overhead (React/Vue) ensures instant load times.
- **Optimization**: Critical assets preloaded; intersection observers for efficient scroll rendering.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Core**: Semantic HTML5, CSS3 Variables, ES6+ Modules.
- **Icons**: FontAwesome 6.
- **Fonts**: 'Inter' and 'Outfit' (Google Fonts).
- **Architecture**: Static Site Generation (SSG) style data separation (`data.js`).

## 🚀 Deployment Architecture

This project utilizes a **Serverless Static Architecture**:

-   **Hosting**: js.org (via Pull Request).
-   **CDN**: Cloudflare Global Network (shielding GitHub Pages).
-   **Security**: Enforced HTTPS (SSL termination via Cloudflare).
